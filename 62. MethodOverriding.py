# Method overriding is a powerful feature in object-oriented programming that
# allows you to redefine a method in a derived class. The method in the
# derived class is said to override the method in the base class. When you
# create an instance of the derived class and call the overridden method, the
# version of the method in the derived class is executed, rather than the
# version in the base class.
